  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Last year, TEST JOURNAL published this paper
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01277">tqdm:
  A Fast, Extensible Progress Meter for Python and CLI</ext-link>.</p>
  <p>While potential authorship issues were noted by reviewers at the
  time and an attempt was made by the submitting author to contact one
  of the other major contributors to the package, JOSS published the
  paper as a single-author paper.</p>
  <p>Sometime later, the authorship (and JOSS handling) of this
  submission was
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01277">flagged
  as problematic</ext-link> by a major contributor to the software and
  JOSS conducted an internal review, and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://joss.theoj.org/about#ethics">concluded</ext-link>
  that there had been an ethical violation and offered the tqdm
  community one month to resolve the authorship issue.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, even after significant efforts from all parties, the
  tqdm community have been unable to resolve this issue and come to an
  agreed set of authors for their paper.</p>

  <title>Resolution</title>
  <p>As a result, with regret, JOSS is today retracting this submission
  due to a violation of its ethical standards.</p>
